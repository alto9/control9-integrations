# Authorization

This doc describes identity, authority, signing, and access boundaries.

## Contract

- GitHub Actions is the first fully contracted provider; GitLab CI follows as the next expansion.
- The integration calls Control9 policy and deploy-verification APIs rather than evaluating full policy packs locally.
